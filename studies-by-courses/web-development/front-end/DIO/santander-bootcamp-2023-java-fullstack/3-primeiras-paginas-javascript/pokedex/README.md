## üìö Introduction

This project was part of the JS/CSS/HTML module from "Santander Bootcamp 2023 - Fullstack Java+Angular" schoolarship organized by DIO.

The main goal of this module was learn how to use the [`Poke API`](https://pokeapi.co/) and integrate it with vanilla JavaScript. It's a fork from the [DIO - Pokedex](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/js-developer-pokedex) and the challenge was to create an additional page or section to show more details (like status, abilities, etc) about the Pokemons.

I did the challenge using a modal and adding infinite scroll instead the "load more" buttom. I will continue to improve this project as I advance in my studies using other technologies. I think it's more interesting to improve projects than to start new ones.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

#### 1. Clone this repository

1.1. This is no ordinary repository. All my personal projects or study codes are in the same repository for organizational reasons. So it's not as simple as using a `git clone`.

You can simply individually copy the files inside this `Pokedex` folder and reproduce the same folder structure on your computer.

1.2. Another way is to clone the entire repository:

`git clone https://github.com/the-physicist/the-physicist.github.io.git`

and navigate to the `Pokedex` folder:

`/studies-by-courses/web-development/front-end/DIO/santander-bootcamp-2023-java-fullstack/3-primeiras-paginas-javascript/pokedex`

#### 2. Deploy it on your favorite HTTP server (I recommend using Live Server with VS Code)

## üåü Future Improvements

- **Implement Framework**: I want to improve it using any framework.

- **Design**: While functional, the design can be refined further.

- **Use best CSS practices**: Implement some CSS practice like BEM.
